# Ocelot
This is a very simple project that provides a more complex example than the [Getting started documentation](https://ocelot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/gettingstarted.html#program) of how to configure Ocelot using:
- [Ocelot](https://ocelot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Dotnet 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- Authentication
- CORS
- [Health Checks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/health-checks?view=aspnetcore-8.0)
- [Serilog](https://serilog.net/)

Check the `src/ApiGateway.Ocelot/ApiGateway/Program.cs` class.
